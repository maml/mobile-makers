Since a byte is eight bits and one bit is used for the sign of the
integer that leaves seven bits on one byte and eight bits on the other,
for a total of 15 bits. The maximum then would be
2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 . . . 2^13 = 16,383
and then the samllest would be -16,383.

An unsigned short (which only holds non-negative numbers) would be
2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 . . . 2^14 = 32,767
