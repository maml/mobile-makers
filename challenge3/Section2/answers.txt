2.1 How did Objective-C become the language to learn if you want to make
apps for the iPhone and iPad?

Objective-C was adopted as the main language of NeXT - the company Steve
Jobs founded after he left Apple in 1985. Everything they built was with
Objective-C. Then Apple bought NeXt in 1996 and rolled everything into what
would become Mac OS X in 2001. And so when the iPhone first came out in 2007,
its operating system was built on OS X (10.5) as was the iPhone SDK which
came out in 2008, the iPad in 2010 and so on.

2.3 Why might you build in one version of iOS but deploy in an older version?

You may wish to target users running older versions of OS X / iOS whereas your
app was developed on a platform using the latest version of OS X.
