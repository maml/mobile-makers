Section 4 - Variables

4.1 What are the primitive data types in Objective-C? Why did Apple add a set of classes
to handle other data types?

int
float
double
char
BOOL

They added a set of classes to handle the other types (like for dates and strings) because
they're not primitive to Objective-C and because they can be represented by combining or
working with the primitive types.

4.2 Make a table of Objective-C primitive data types. Add numeric data types and
their properties to this table.

int               4 bytes
long int          4 bytes (32-bit)     8 bytes (64-bit)
long long int     8 bytes (32-bit)     8 bytes (64-bit)
short int         2 bytes
float             4 bytes
double            8 bytes
char              1 byte
BOOL              1 byte

4.3 Add char and BOOL (the character data types) to your table created above.

4.4 Describe in your own words what the scope of a variable is in Objective-C

Basically the scope is local to the section of code in which it's declared (function,
loop, etc.) as well as any nested sections, however many levels deep.

Variables of the same name can be declared at different levels of code sections and
in that case whatever's closest, wins.

Copies may be passed between functions.

Globals may be declared and changed by anything in the program, at any time, and are
considered an anti-pattern.

4.5 What does "enum" allow you to do?

Enum -> Enumerated Data type - a data type with a restricted range of values. They default
to integer values and start with 0 and increment by 1. Optionally the integer values may
be set when they are declared.

4.6 When would you define your own data type versus using an enum?

you can assign a new name to an existing data type, if that data type is a custom type (like
if it was an enum) it can make it easier to create and reference variables of that type.
